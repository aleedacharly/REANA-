# Theory of Dimensionality reduction

We show here 3 different alogithms to perform dimensionality reduction and describe how to manage data flow between different pipelines using S3 private storage, all through REANA.
 
### UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection):

**Pros:**
- Preservation of Local and Global Structure
- Scalability
- Fewer Hyperparameters

**Cons:**
- Sensitivity to Hyperparameters
- Interpretability Challenges

### t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding):

**Pros:**
- Preservation of Local Structure
- Visualization Quality

**Cons:**
- Computational Intensity
- Non-deterministic
- Crowding Problem

### PCA (Principal Component Analysis):

**Pros:**
- Computational Efficiency
- Interpretability
- Linear Technique

**Cons:**
- Assumption of Linearity
- Limited for Complex Structures
- Variance-Based Approach

# Unsupervised Machine learning workflow elements
* Get the N-dimentional data
* Fix parameters if possible  
* Project data with different algorithms: **t-SNE**, **UMAP**, **PCA**
* plot them side by side 
* upload results to S3
* download from S3 previous plots if exists
* combine into one grid plot to pdf 

# Data management 
This example is describing how to manage the data between different pipelines using S3 private storage.
The data round trip is following:
* download data from remote TAP service
* analyze it and plot the results
* save and upload to S3
* download if plots exists
* combine them and upload to S3

# Requirements
* access to **s3.data.aip.de** storage: 
  * **S3_ACCESS_KEY** and **S3_SECRET_KEY**
* data access to remote **TAP** service
  * we use public datasets from **gaia.aip.de** 

# Keys and secrets management
We use **reana-client secrets** management (see also [here](https://docs.reana.io/reference/reana-client-cli-api/#secret-management-commands)):

`reana-client secrets-add --env access_key=XXX`  
`reana-client secrets-add --env secret_key=XXX`

(The keys will be shared during the Tutorial)

In this way we can use the added key as environment variables in our code, by simply calling, e.g., `os.environ['access_key']`. These will be used to access a private folder on S3 storage.

# Running the example on REANA

The **reana.yaml** file for this example is quite simple and made of 2 steps:
- `make-projections` runs the 3 projections for a number of times specified by the `n_test` parameter and uploads the results to S3;
- `combine-plots` retrieves all the plots and combines them in a single pdf file.
